<p>Wireless firmware updates are attractive. No wires, no broken cheap microUSB
cables, no annoying grabbing in the box full cables to find the right one üòÅ.
For one of my project I decided to implement over the air updates of firmware
(or shortly OTA). The choice of wireless stack fell on Bluetooth. Actually, I
was thinking how I can utilize my HC-05 modules. These are really cheap and
could do a decent job for a simple wireless applications.</p>

<h2 id="how-bootloader-works">How bootloader works?</h2>
<p>Let's start from some theory. Initially I didn't want to tamper with a
bootloader but it seems like there is no other simpler way. So, firstly let's
investigate how exactly it works and how to change it to upload data through the
Bluetooth.</p>
<p><strong>Internal memory</strong>. All microcontrollers used in Arduino have internal flash
memory. This memory is used to store the code of an application and bootloader.
The important feature of ATMega MCU is that flash is "In-System
self-programmable". That means that MCU can updates its own memory without use
of external devices. As I said there is actually two application sitting in the
memory an application and bootloader.</p>
<p><strong>The bootloader</strong>. It is simple application which is always stored in the
flash memory of microcontroller but could be rewritten as everything else. When
you power on your Arduino it doesn't immediately goes to your application, it
actually starts at specific address, so called <strong>Reset vector</strong>. This
address has "jump" instruction which tells microcontroller to jump to the
address where bootloader is located. You can actually get rid of bootloader and
jump straight to the application code but this approach has some major
disadvantages.</p>
<p class="note-right">
    <span class="note-sign">Note: </span> For example, one of the disadvantages
    is - that if your application will start updating itself and hang during the
    process or connection to the host will be lost - you will end up with
    non-working software which won't be able to update itself anymore.
</p>

<p>The further action depends on the bootloader. In most cases it starts with
setup of essential peripherals such as communication interface. Next, it starts
waiting for the data on this interface. This is the moment when PC starts sending
bytes to the Arduino. Actually there is the whole communication protocol - you
can find more details in the official specification <a href="http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/Appnotes/doc2591.pdf">STK500</a>. The bootloader
receives data from the PC and writes it to the memory. After communication is
complete bootloader jumps to the address where application is stored. From now
on, MCU is in control of the application.</p>
<p>
<figure class="article-figure"><img alt="Bootloader process" src="images/bootloader-principle.png"></figure>
</p>
<p><strong>Does it have to be serial/USB?</strong>. No, it does not! It could be anything -
memory chip, USB, wifi or even LoRa (wouldn't use this one for firmware updates
üòÅ). Basically, you can get your newest fancy firmware from anywhere. On most of
the Arduinos there is USB to UART controller which give us possibility to talk
to the microcontroller via USB port. But, we can connect our microcontroller to
any communication interface. So, how we can exploit it? The HC-05 is Bluetooth
module which supports "Serial Port Profile". That means that those modules
emulates a serial port over Bluetooth üòÄ. FYI: There are many more different 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Bluetooth_profiles">Bluetooth profiles</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The plan</strong>. There are some articles on implementation of the "Over the
Air" updates based on combination of Arduino and HC-05. In this post I describe
realization which needs only one soldered wire to the HC-05. However,
before uploading new firmware you need to press a reset button to reset the
board. It can be seen as a completely wrong as it's much more convenient to have
everything automatic. But, it is super easy to setup and I see it as a security
features (not a restrictionüëå), as to upload firmware to the device you need
physical access to it, so nobody else can do it.</p>
<h2 id="over-the-air-updates-preparation">Over-the-air updates preparation</h2>
<p>The setup is following - Arduino is connected to the Bluetooth module. Instead
of connecting USB cable you pair your PC with HC-05 module. OS will create a
serial port which you already know how to use. As I previously mentioned, there
is need to manually reset the board. After pressing a reset button bootloader
will start waiting for data on UART. With Arduino IDE (or actually <code>avrdude</code>)
you write data to the Bluetooth port. The data or more precisely firmware is
read by Bootloader and stored to the memory.</p>
<p>To make it work we need to do two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adjust bootloader timeout to the delays in Bluetooth communication</li>
<li>Configure HC-05 to communicate with Arduino by setting up correct baudrate </li>
<li>Bonus: set some fancy name for the Bluetooth module</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="setting-up-optiboot">Setting up Optiboot</h3>
<p>I decided to try one of the popular bootloaders with lot of useful features -
<a href="https://github.com/Optiboot/optiboot">optiboot</a>. As I later discovered, timeouts have already been implemented.
So, one task is done ü§î. I set timeout to the longest one available - 8 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Compile</strong>. After reading a little bit a Makefile I successfully compiled it
for ATMega328p with 8 seconds timeout and 57600 baudrate. Check out <a href="https://github.com/Optiboot/optiboot/wiki/CompilingOptiboot">official
documentation</a> for more information on how to compile Optiboot for other
boards.</p>

</code></pre></div>
</p>
<p><strong>Why change timeout?</strong> The long timeout is required as Bluetooth protocol
needs time to setup the connection. When you want to upload new firmware
computer opens serial port attached to the Bluetooth channel. Bluetooth, in
turn, tries to connect to the device. This process takes time and is much longer
than UART/USB. I suppose that 4 or even 2 seconds timeouts would do the job but
I didn't test it.</p>
<p><strong>Bootloader baudrate</strong>. The default baudrate of the bootloader is <code>115200</code>.
I've decide to change it to <code>57600</code> as it is default one for <code>avrdude</code> in
Arduino IDE and platformio. But that means that I need to change baudrate on the
HC-05 module, as default one is <code>38400</code>.</p>
<h3 id="installing-bootloader-with-arduino-nano">Installing bootloader with Arduino Nano</h3>
<p>The uploading process was a little bit tricky because all of my wires,
breadboards and Arduinos are from cheap Chinese manufactures üòê. The quality
is close to very bad. The main problem was loosely connection wires as they had
glue on the metallic tip. So, if communication is unstable try to move around
with those wires - it could be a reason why. Also, don't use the longest one.</p>
<p><strong>Arduino as ISP programmer</strong>. The first step is to take another Arduino and
upload ArduionISP sketch from the standard set of examples <code>Examples -&gt;
11. ArduinoISP -&gt; ArduinoISP</code>. This application turns your Arduino into a
programmer (like you heh). </p>
<p>
<figure class="article-figure"><img alt="Installing bootloader with Arduino Nano" src="images/nano-update-bootloader.png"></figure>
</p>
<p>You can also add some LEDs to a programmer to see the state of uploading
process. I highly recommend doing so as it helps a lot with debugging. The LEDs
are connected as follows:</p>
<p>
            <div  class="highlight"  id="code-b613850c-6cb3-11f0-a4b5-8990e32368c1">

                  onclick="copy_to_clipboard(document.getElementById('code-b613850c-6cb3-11f0-a4b5-8990e32368c1').getElementsByTagName('code')[0])">
                    copy
                </button>
        <pre><span></span><code>// Put an LED (with resistor) on the following pins:
// 9: Heartbeat - shows the programmer is running
// 8: Error - Lights up if something goes wrong (use red if that makes sense)
// 7: Programming - In communication with the slave
</code></pre></div>
</p>
<p>As I use it quite often I soldered it and now I can use it as standalone device:</p>
<p>
<figure class="article-figure"><img alt="Custom board for uploading bootloading into Arduino" src="images/arduino-bootloader-loader.png"></figure>
</p>
<p><strong>How does it work?</strong> The principle is following - the ArduinoISP is connected
to the PC. Over the SPI this Arduino connects to the ICSP (those six pin put
aside) of the Arduino we want to program. On the PC you run <code>avrdude</code> on port
attached to the programmer. The programmer transfers commands and data to the
connected board.</p>
<h3 id="testing-bootloader">Testing Bootloader</h3>
<p>Before starting with Bluetooth let's test that bootloader works at all.
Connect programmed Arduino to the PC and try uploading some firmware as usual
(e.g. blink blink blink...üí°). It should work as before with built-in
bootloader.</p>
<h2 id="bluetooth-module">Bluetooth Module</h2>
<h3 id="how-to-change-hc-05-configuration">How to change HC-05 configuration</h3>
<p>The module has two modes - one for normal operation and one for changing
configuration with AT commands. Firstly, you need a serial adapter to send
commands to the module from the PC. </p>
<p><strong>Serial interface to the module</strong>. If you have a USB to serial adapter
(something like <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32826575637.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.1a1b152byezyN0&amp;algo_pvid=1415518c-b43a-43ee-bc72-99da975e1540&amp;algo_expid=1415518c-b43a-43ee-bc72-99da975e1540-0&amp;btsid=0be3764315876534842897724efca8&amp;ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_,searchweb201603_">this</a>) I would suggest using it. But you can replace it with
another Arduino with serial passthrough application.</p>
<p class="note-left">
    <span class="note-sign">Note: </span> By serial passthrough application I
    mean the app which reads data on one serial port and send it to another one
    and vise versa.

<figure class="article-figure"><img alt="Image of setup to change configuration in HC-05" src="images/hc-05-configuration.png"></figure>
</p>
<p>The Arduino is connected to the PC with a cable. I used Arduino Nano which has
only one serial port. Therefore, my only port is occupied by a PC. But we need a
second one for the HC-05. The solution is amazing <SoftwareSerial.h> library
which allows simulate serial communication on some pins. Upload following sketch
into your board:</p>

<p>Possibly, you will need to play a little bit with baud rate. My module had
default one <code>38400</code> but I think I saw modules with <code>57600</code>. So, try both‚úåÔ∏è..</p>
<p><strong>Boot into AT mode</strong>. Connect HC-05 module as shown in the figure above. Then,
turn off and turn on the module by disconnecting power wire (only module, D3 pin
should stay High). If pin 34 is high, HC-05 will boot in the AT mode.</p>
<p><strong>Changing configuration</strong>. Open serial monitor on your PC. The following
sequence of commands checks version of the HC-05 module, switches module to the
slave mode and sets baudrate to <code>57600</code> with 1 stop bin and no parity. There is
actually much <a href="https://www.itead.cc/wiki/Serial_Port_Bluetooth_Module_(Master/Slave)_:_HC-05">more commands</a>.</p>

<p>You can also change name with <code>AT+NAME=name</code>. I created a <a href="https://github.com/alberand/hctools">small application</a>
which could be easier to use if you want to configure multiple devices.</p>
<h3 id="testing-bluetooth-communication">Testing Bluetooth communication</h3>
<p>On Windows, after connecting with a Bluetooth manager, HC-05 should be visible
as <code>COMx</code> port. You can find exact port name in the "Device Manager". Anyway,
the port should be visible directly in in the Arduino IDE. On Linux there is a
little bit more steps to do to connect the module. I wrote <a href="https://alberand.com/hc-05-linux.html">the whole
article</a> on that topic ü§®. However, if you have a decent Bluetooth chip and
drivers it should be simple.</p>
<p class="note-left">
    <span class="note-sign">Note: </span> On Linux after connecting HC-05 with a
    Bluetooth manager it should be enough to bind it with a `rfcomm`. 
</p>

<p>Let's test that communication works at all before even trying to update
firmware. Upload the same "serial pass-through" firmware but with correct
baudrate. By the correct one I mean that which you set in the HC-05 module with
<code>AT+UART</code> command (<code>57600</code> if you did the same).</p>
<p>Then, run the serial monitor on the port with Arduino (e.g. <code>COM1</code> or üêß
<code>/dev/ttyUSB0</code>). And another one on virtual port attached to Bluetooth channel
(e.g. <code>COM2</code> or üêß <code>/dev/rfcomm0</code>).</p>
<h2 id="uploading-firmware-over-bluetooth">Uploading firmware over Bluetooth</h2>
<p>Time to try it. Prepare some simple application such as "Blink" and do the
following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Compile application</li>
<li>Press reset button on the Arduino</li>
<li>Run <code>avrdude</code> on serial port attached to the Bluetooth channel (or Upload
   button in Arduino IDE)</li>
</ol>
<p>It works well in both Arduino IDE and platformio. However, <code>avrdude</code> can't
sometimes synchronize with the bootloader and start printing errors. Simply reset
the board again and it will catch up.</p>
<h2 id="future-improvements">Future Improvements</h2>
<p>Updating firmware by overwriting the old one is a bad idea. If communication
isn't reliable, or device unexpectedly turns off, the firmware could corrupt and
becomes unusable. The better way is to use external memory chip (or internal
memory if your program is small enough) - write firmware on the external memory
first, then copy it to the primary location and run it.</p>
<p>One of the bootloader which allows this is <a href="https://github.com/LowPowerLab/DualOptiboot">DualOptiboot</a>. I am planning to
try this one in the next version of my Bluetooth controller. The first step will
be to choose a memory chip and add it to the board.</p>
<p>The setup is quite simple and definitely not suitable for any device for sale.
Nevertheless, there is <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/device-firmware-update-cookbook">amazing article</a> on the Interrupt blog which lists
much more details on how to build reliable firmware update mechanism.</p>
